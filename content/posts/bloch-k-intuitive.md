## How to understand reciprocal space

For lattice periodic, the integral number in k space is enough to describe that kinds of functions in real space.

`$$V(r)=$$`

However, wavefunction in real space may have larger periodic according to the Born-van-Karmen boundary condition.
That is way we need small k (fractional) to describe the function.
